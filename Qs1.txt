In general, the timeit module is faster than implementing a timer decorator since the it uses a more accurate mechanism and runs the specified code multiple time and takes the average time taken. Meaning that it reduces any other effects that might alter the timing. However, the timer decorator takes the time taken for a single run of the code, so it is more vulnerable to effects of other factors which makes it less accurate.
