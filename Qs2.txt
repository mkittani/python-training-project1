Basically, both the static and class methods are considered part of the classes in python but not objects of the class. To use any of them we should include a specific decorator for each one before we implement the code we want. In class methods, it takes the class as the first argument to modify the class state and know about it, and the @classmethod decorator should be included. However, the static method doesn’t have any specific parameters and cannot access or modify the class state and doesn’t know about its state but we also need to include a specific decorator @staticmethod. even when excuting a simple code that prints out the word "Hello", we can notice the difference in timing.
